My introduction website


My first laravel website! Just made it as simple as possible in order to get used to the framework, also practiced and improved my knowledge of css/js :)

When this project is finished you should be able to:

- Login and register
- Post a blog
- Delete a blog
- Edit your blog

However I want to use this site in order to introduce myself after I've wrapped it up.
